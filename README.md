# Xpressed-N-Ink: A creative writing sharing platform

Project: Xpressed - N - Ink

About the project

Xpressed-N-Ink is a personal project that is intended to allow users to submit their own creative works by annonymous means. These creative works can be short stories, poetry, experiances and much more. The main idea behind this project was to encourage others to express their feelings while having the option to be annonymous. I believe this can help with the present suicide statistics.
